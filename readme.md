[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mul.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/mul)

`mul` (my useless language) is a useless, interpreted programming language. 
I created it to learn more about programming languages without any 
utility expectation whatsoever.

It features:
- dynamic, strong typing
- lambda functions
- functional paradigm
- easy to write interpreter (≈26Kb/742 LOC of python)
- REPL

# Hello, world!
```
greeter = {:(who) print('Hello, ' + who + '!');};
greeter("world");
```
`pip install mul && mul hello_world.mul` (*needs `python3.11.0rc2` or above*)

# Main characteristics

The implementation is in Python, but in the future I'd like to port it to 
a compiled language (maybe Rust).

The language is designed to be easy to write an interpreter for (therefore 
its uselessness).

By default, every variable is read-only. You can overwrite variables by 
consciously using the `set` function.
```
a = 5;
a = 6; # error Cannot re-assign symbol 'a'.
set('a', 6);
print(a); # prints '6.0'
```
There are no statements, and everything is an expression, with a return value.
If you play around with the REPL you will get what I mean:
```
$ mul
> nickname = 'mattmezza';
Type.STR
mattmezza
> f = {};
Type.FN
<function>
```
- an assignment returns the assigned value
- a fn call returns the last expression in the fn definition

# Syntax

## Whitespaces

Whitespace is not influencing parsing. All whitespaces are stripped out after 
lexical analysis.

## Symbols

Identifiers can only use `[_a-zA-Z0-9!?]` and they have to start with `[_a-zA-Z]`.

## Literals

Numbers can only use `[.0-9]` (so no negative numbers – use `0 - num;` instead).
Strings can be created with either double `"..."` or single `'...'` quotes. 
Escaping is not implemented but you can have multiline strings. 
You can mix quotes within string to accomplish something like this:
```
> '"Hello", she said.'
"Hello", she said.
```
# Types

There are just a few types baked into the language: `None`, `Number`, `String` and `Function`.

## `None`

`None` is a type that you can instantiate from the literal `none`.

## `Number`

No distinction between integer or float, everything is a number
```
num = 4.3;
another_num = 5;
```
Negative numbers are not supported (sorry). You can use the following:
```
negative_num = 0 - 4;
```
`0` is considered `false` and anything else is considered `true` even without 
having the explicit concept of a `Boolean` type.

`true` and `false` themselves are implemented as functions like so:
```
true = {1;};
false = {0;};
```
## `String`

Strings can be created with single or double quotes.
```
name = 'Matteo';
nickname = "mattmezza";
```
Strings can be concatenated with `+`.

## `Function`

Functions can be defined like so:
```
fullname = {
    fname = 'Matteo';
    lname = 'M';
    fname + lname;
};
```
The last expression is what the function will return when called. 
Functions can be called like so:
```
fullname();
```
Anonymous function calls are supported:
```
{:(fname, lname) fname + ' ' + lname}('matt', 'mezza');
```
Functions can have arguments defined as formal params like so:
```
fullname = {:(fname, lname)
    fname + lname;
};
```
As you would expect, such function can be called like so:
```
fullname('Matt', 'M');
```
# Operators and precedence

`mul` only has diadic operations implemented (so no monadic ops for now).
This means you can't do `-2;` but you'd rather do `0-2;`.

The implemented operators are:
- `+` as in `2+3;` returning `5`
- `-` as in `2-3;` returning `-1`
- `*` as in `2*3;` returning `6`
- `/` as in `2/3;` returning `0.6666666666666666`

The precedence is what you'd expect:
- `2+3*4;` returning `14`
- `2+3/3;` returning `3`
- `3*4/12;` returning `1`

# Control flow

There are no other constructs in the language (no `if`, no `for`, no `while`, 
etc...). In order to make the language a little bit more useful, such 
constructs are implemented in a native way in the form of a function.

For instance, there is an `if` function that you can use like so:
```
if(boolean, function, function_else);
```
# Comments

Single line comments are allowed by prepending the comment text with a `#`.
```
# this is a comment
a = 5;  # this is a comment too
```
# The standard library

A very small `std` has been built so far. It includes things like:

- `list` a pair based list implementation
- `logic` things like `and`, `or`, `all`, etc...
- `operator` functions like `sum`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, etc...

The `std` lib is extremely sparse and unstructured, beware.

## Native hooks implementation

`mul` is implemented via native function call hooks that make it possible to 
export host language feature to `mul` itself (as done for the `if` function).

Native hooks implementation can be leveraged to quickly fill holes in the 
`std` lib.

A number of functions are implemented via native hooks:
- `char_at`
- `concat`
- `equals`
- `lt`
- `gt`
- `if`
- `len`
- `print`
- `set`

# Tooling

## Execution

`mul` programs can be run via `$ mul program.mul`.

Given `hello_world.mul` containing:
```
greeter = {:(who) print('Hello, ' + who + '!');};
greeter('world');
```
```
$ mul hello_world.mul
Hello, world!
```
There is also a `REPL` interface:
```
$ mul
> a = 5;
Type.NUM
5.0
```
`ctrl+d` quits the `REPL`.

## Development

- `mul program.mul -t`: prints the tokens as parsed by the lexer
- `mul program.mul -a`: prints the AST as parsed by the parser

# Code Examples
```
pow =
{:(b, e)
   if(equals(0, e), {1;}, {
        pow(b, e - 1) * b;
   });
};
print(pow(2, 3));  # prints 8
```
```
true = {1;};
false = {0;};
not = {:(v) if(v, false, true);};
and = {:(a,b) if(a, {if(b, true, false);}, false);};
or = {:(a,b) if(a, true, {if(b, true, false);});};
le = {:(v1, v2) if(or(lt(v1, v2), equals(v1, v2)), true, false);};
ge = {:(v1, v2) if(or(gt(v1, v2), equals(v1, v2)), true, false);};
```
For more examples, browse through the [std](https://github.com/mattmezza/mul/tree/main/std) lib.

# Installation

`pip install mul` installs the latest version of `mul`. Make sure 
you have a virtual env with `python3.11.0rc2` or newer.

# Programmatic usage

`mul` can be used within python projects as a library.

```
import mul


i = mul.Interpreter.with_std()
a = i.eval('a = 5;')
b = i.eval('b = 10;')
res = i.eval('res = a + b;')
print(res.val)  # prints 15
```

# Contributing

I don't know if I will have time to review PRs and contributions but you can 
have fun with the language and maybe port it to other host languages. If you 
do, let me know, I'm a sucker for programming languages and I would enjoy 
checking out what you did.

`mul` is inspired by [cell](https://github.com/andybalaam/cell). Thanks to Andy 
explaining rather difficult concepts in such a simple way.
